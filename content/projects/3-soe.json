  "description": "State of Emergency was/is one of the roleplay communities for modified cop-vs-robbers Grand Theft Auto 5 servers. It was the first server I ever played on, as this mod was brand new. They used some really outdated software for their website that was integrated with the game, so I used it as an opportunity to surprise the team that ran it with a brand new custom website. It was complete with a calculator for issuing players tickets/infractions on the cop side (everyone used this and loved it), complete forum system with integrated in-game roles and a beautiful/sleek modern design. I ended up leaving this community to focus on my school studies so the site was unfortunately never implemented or presented to them.",
