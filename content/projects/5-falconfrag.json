  "description": "Falcon Frag Networks was a (mostly Minecraft) game server hosting company I ran while I was in high school. The site initially ran unchanged, off-the-shelf WHMCS and for a 'version 2.0' of the company, I wanted everything to have a seamless integration and customization. This kicked off my interest in Laravel 4.2 as I began writing my own rendition of WHMCS from scratch. Ultimately this niche industry saw a serious decline, which is why this project was halted and never finished.",
