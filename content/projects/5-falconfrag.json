  "description": "Landscape Business Management Software (LBMS) is a SaaS application I began working on last year after experiencing some of the pains that landscaping business owners endure. People had a lot of ideas in things they wanted if the 'perfect' software existed, and a lot of things that they didn't like about their current software. I used all this feedback to build the roadmap for my own software and it's something I enjoy working on in my free time.",
